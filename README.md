=============

This is a software tool for analysis of immunogold labeled electron micrographs. In particular, it is used to analyse gold labeling along membrane segments or other open linear paths. It is of course also possible to use the tool for other types of two-dimensional spatial point patterns. 

This tool is used in conjunction with its companion ImageJ plugin DistToPath_.java.
