=============

DistToPath.py is a software tool for analysis of immunogold labeled electron
micrographs. Specifically, it is used to analyse gold labeling along membrane
segments or other open linear paths. It is of course also possible to use the
tool for other types of two-dimensional spatial point patterns.

DistToPath.py is used in conjunction with its companion ImageJ plugin,
DistToPath_.java.
